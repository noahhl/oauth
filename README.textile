<h1>oauth: a simple oauth 1.0 client for R</h1>

This is a simple implementation of an Oauth 1.0 client for the <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> statistical programming language. External dependencies are limited to RCurl and digest. Syntax is (largely) simple.

This package is essentially unreleased/pre-pre-pre-alpha. Use at your own risk. <b>Please</b> report errors, etc.

<h2>Usage:</h2>
1) Create a list with the parameters for your application, structured as below:

<pre>
params <- list(oauth_consumer_key = "B2QJkcSYdARDJ10Gjo2kNw", 
            oauth_consumer_secret = "WJPF3SENJdk3ACSDF1OJfVJ5EDI3BkYbEQASDFSFA", 
            oauth_callback="http://somedomain.com",
            oauth_signature_method = "HMAC-SHA1",
            oauth_version="1.0", 
            server = list(
                          #To get request token
                          initiate = "https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token",
                          #For user authentication
                          auth = "https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize",
                          #For access token
                          token = "https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token")
)
</pre>

2) Run the <code>Authorize()</code> command, passing it your parameters, optionally with parameters to enable "noisy" output or to specify not to save credentials beyond this session. Recapture the output back into <code>params</code>.

<pre>
params <- Authorize(params, noisy=F, save=T, file=NULL)
</pre> 

3) IF you've previously auth'd, you can reload the credentials using the <code>LoadCredentials(site)</code> or <code>LoadCredentials(file)</code> command, passing it either a path to a previously saved credential file, or the name of the service you are trying to auth for (e.g., <code>api.twitter</code>)

<pre>
  LoadCredentials("api.twitter")
  LoadCredentials("~/mytwittercrdentials")
</pre>

4) Make a request, using the <code>MakeRequest(params, resource, method, request=NULL, noisy=F)</code> command. Some examples for <a href = "http://developer.twitter.com/doc/">Twitter</a> are provided below. Briefly:
<ul>
  <li><code>params</code> are the resultant params from an <code>Authorize()</code> command, or the <code>params</code> loaded from <code>LoadCredentials</code></li>
  <li><code>resource</code> is the URL of the resource you are trying to access. If this is a request in which you would pass request parameters (e.g., <code>?search=abcdefg</code>), do not include those parameters in the resource URL.</li>
  <li><code>method</code> is one of "GET", "POST", "PUT", or "DELETE".</li>
  <li><code>request</code> are any request parameters provided as a named character vector (e.g., <code>c(search="Test", since="yesterday")</code>)</li>
</ul>

<pre>
#Verify credentials
MakeRequest(params, "http://api.twitter.com/1/account/verify_credentials.json", "GET")

#Send a tweet
MakeRequest(params, "http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/update.json", "POST", request=c(status="#rstats is my hero."))

</pre>
