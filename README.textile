<h1>oauth: a simple oauth 1.0 client for R</h1>

This is a simple implementation of an Oauth 1.0 client for the <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> statistical programming language. Focus has been made on limiting external dependencies to RCurl and digest, and on providing a simple syntax. 

This package is unreleased/alpha. Use at your own risk.

<h2>Usage:</h2>
1) Create a list with the parameters for your application, structured as below:

<pre>
params <- list(oauth_consumer_key = "B2QJkcSYdARDJ10Gjo2kNw", 
            oauth_consumer_secret = "WJPF3SENJdk3ACSDF1OJfVJ5EDI3BkYbEQASDFSFA", 
            oauth_callback="http://somedomain.com",
            oauth_signature_method = "HMAC-SHA1",
            oauth_version="1.0", 
            server = list(
                          #To get request token
                          initiate = "https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token",
                          #For user authentication
                          auth = "https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize",
                          #For access token
                          token = "https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token")
)
</pre>

2) Run the <code>Authorize()</code> command, passing it your parameters, optionally with parameters to enable "noisy" output or to specify not to save credentials beyond this session. Recapture the output back into <code>params</code>.

<pre>
params <- Authorize(params, noisy=F, save=T)
</pre> 

3) IF you've previously auth'd, you can reload the credentials using the <code>LoadCredentials(consumer_key)</code> command, passing it the consumer key for the app you're using.

<pre>
  LoadCredentials("B2QJkcSYdARDJ10Gjo2kNw")
</pre>

4) Make a request, using the <code>MakeRequest(params, resource, method, request=NULL, noisy=F)</code> command. Some examples for <a href = "http://developer.twitter.com/doc/">Twitter</a> are provided below.

<pre>
#Verify credentials
MakeRequest(params, "http://api.twitter.com/1/account/verify_credentials.json", "GET")

#Send a tweet
MakeRequest(params, "http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/update.json", "POST", request=c(status="#rstats is my hero."))

</pre>
